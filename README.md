A tool to help map out quadratic functions onto music!

Heres the vision: I was trying to see what would happen if I mapped out Polynomial Functions onto a Piano/Keybaord.

I Made this Python code to help do the math without the painful process of imagining a absurdley long keyboard and 
counting the correct intervals between notes

More detail coming soon!
